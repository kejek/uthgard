# uthgard
This project was design to search the utghard API at www2.uthgard.net and return relevant character information.
It also inserted the returned data into a mysql database to chart character data via chartJS and display that information in
after a character was searched. A (hopefully) working example can be seen at www.mattgoldsworthy.com/uthgard - As the API has changed
and will continue changing, this can break at anytime.
